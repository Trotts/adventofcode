# Advent of Code
## Cameron Trotter

This repo contains my answers (and generated input files) for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), starting with [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/).

All answers are programmed in Python, and I've tried to keep each part of the answer somewhat self contained for readability, unless doing so would have been overkill.
